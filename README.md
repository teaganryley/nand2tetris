#NAND2TETRIS

These files are part of www.nand2tetris.org and the book "The Elements of Computing Systems" by Nisan and Schocken, MIT Press.

Projects included in this repository are my implementations, as guided by the aforementioned text. I have retained the project structure outlined in the book, and therefore implementation, test scripts, and test results exist in the same project folder.
